Note found in the pocket of Smith A, John on May 17, 2052
	Many things have goner wrong in the world. I have made the mistake of giving
my daughter I love away to slavery on the first of this month. I wish her mother
was still with me… the last I herd of her she had broken the law of proper use
of resources and was sold to slavery. That was 15 years ago. I was in dept to 
the king and offered my daughter thinking I could buy her back but the money I
thought I was going to have by the 15th never came through  when I went to
ask the king for an option he kicked me out and told me I was lucky he didn't
have me killed. With no money, no place to stay, my Daughter and wife gone I
have decided to end it all. Good bye to who ever sees this.

*May the king die in agony.*

The Kings Journal 
	Sept 23, 2051
	Absolute power corrupts absolutely. I have been given a third of what used 
to be the United States of America and Central America all the way to Panama. I
am the supreme leader of my people. I have a duty to protect them and provide
for them. Why cant the other leaders understand this? How did democracy end so
fast? I remember only 5 years ago I was working on becoming a police officer to
protect my fellow citizens. Now I am there king. How did I surpass that of my
uncles children to become king? How do I keep from becoming a terrible leader
like thous of the other leaders in America? I must find a way to balance my self
and the power I have like that of the democracy of the United States of America
be for the conquering of the 14 kings of 2023.

SOMEWERE IN THE WEST KINGDOM May 3rd, 2056
> I pledge alegince to the flag of the United States of America. And to the
republic for which it stands, One Nation Under God, Indivsable, with liberty and
Justice to all.” Lt. Franklen muted the monitor of the spy camera that the
police had placed in the house of a suspected resistance members.

“Well looks like you were right captain, How do we proceed?” Franklen asked as
he stood up to get coffee.

“You have been working with me a what two years now. Why dont you tell me what
you think.” His captain replied

“Well… the laws say that they are traders to the king and the punishment is
slavery for the rest of there lives. But after watching there meeting I don't
see any way that they are hurting anyone. And this group never said may the king
die in agony like the other cults have.”

“They are people that belive in a free country like what we had before...”
Franklens captain interupted “They do not worship any gods so they are a
resistance not a cult.”

“Sorry Captain just from what I have seen it looks like it. And as far as this
group I don't see them harming anyone so we should maybe just keep an eye on them?”

“I agree but we don't report this to anyone, If we do it might be taken out of
our controll and we would not be able to keep these people safe.” The captain
said sturnly

“But captain if anyone found out...”

“then it will be my head you were just following orders.”

Lizzy's diary April 28th 
I am worried about my dad, he is way to far in dept and the king sent a notice
that he is to appear at the castle for discussion of what to do about it.
Everyone I know that goes before the king about there dept gets sold to slavery.
At least the king is merciful to the children of slaves. He will provide housing
food any education but sence I am 16 turning 17 at the end of next month I am
worried he will not see me as a child. We will see what happens.
					-May the king die in agony
